## About this project

The game consists in moving disks from a starting rod to a final rod by respecting some rules :

- Only one disk may be moved at a time.
- Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
- No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.
